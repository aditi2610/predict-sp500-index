S&P 500 (Standard and Poor 500) is the stock market index that measures the stock performance of 500 large companies in the US.   
In this project, I built models to predict the stock prices for it based on the available variables and historical data.  
I used machine learning algorithms like Decision trees, Random forests, Gradient boosting, Neural networks, and Facebookâ€™s prophet in this project.
